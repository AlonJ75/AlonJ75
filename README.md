## ðŸªª About Me:

<p align="justify">My name is Alon, I am 20 years old, and have 10 years of programming experience.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2012, I started coding while playing an online game called "Everybody Edits" (which is no longer available). I taught myself C# to make bots, which are like helper programs that tweak how the game works for my benefit. These bots were made using C# and the .NET framework, along with a library called PlayerIO (since the game ran on PlayerIO). This experience not only improved my coding skills but also gave me insights into how online games and servers function.</p>

  Towards the end of 2012, I introduced my first bot to the public. I named it "Command Bot" and made it available on MediaFire. Surprisingly, it garnered nearly 1,000 downloads.

</p>

<p align="justify">Later on, I took it upon myself to learn Java. Since it shares similarities with C#, I found the learning process quite smooth. I dived into Java with the intention of crafting mods for the game Minecraft, along with developing server plugins. Throughout my journey of programming for Minecraft projects, I gained proficiency in working with a variety of different APIs.</p>

<p align="justify">During this period, I invested in my learning journey by enrolling in two Udemy courses. The first course delved into MySQL, offering a comprehensive understanding of SQL databases. I gained insights into the distinctions between SQL and No-SQL, delved into the inner workings of databases, and acquired proficiency in various commands needed to operate and maintain such databases.
<br/>
In the second course, I ventured into fullstack web development, comprehending both the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications. The curriculum encompassed key tools like NodeJS for backend functionality, MongoDB for database management, and ExpressJS. This comprehensive training empowered me to autonomously craft fully functional websites that seamlessly integrate both front-end and back-end components.</p>

<p align="justify">Moreover, I extended my learning to coding for the Android operating system using Java. Building upon my existing knowledge of the Java language, delving into Android app development proved to be a relatively smooth process. As part of a school project, I designed an Android game inspired by Miniclip's SoccerStars. My efforts bore fruit as my project was recognized as the top-performing Android endeavor among those submitted.</p>

<p align="justify">Around mid-2020, a significant shift occurred in the online landscape when browsers announced the discontinuation of Flash support. Consequently, the future of Everybody Edits, a game reliant on Flash technology, was also cast into uncertainty. 
<br>
As the impending closure loomed, Xenonetix, the game's owner at the time, extended an invitation to me to join his development team. Our goal was to create a version of Everybody Edits that people could download and play offline. Working together with another developer named Seb135, we combined our skills to make this idea a reality. We later shared this project with the public on GitHub, embracing an <a href="https://github.com/Seb-135/ee-offline">open-source</a> approach.</p>
