## ðŸªª About Me:

<p align="justify">My name is Alon, I am 20 years old, and have 10 years of programming experience.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2012, I started coding while playing an online game called "Everybody Edits" (which is no longer available). I taught myself C# to make bots, which are like helper programs that tweak how the game works for my benefit. These bots were made using C# and the .NET framework, along with a library called PlayerIO (since the game ran on PlayerIO). This experience not only improved my coding skills but also gave me insights into how online games and servers function.</p>

  Towards the end of 2012, I introduced my first bot to the public. I named it "Command Bot" and made it available on MediaFire. Surprisingly, it garnered nearly 1,000 downloads.

</p>

<p align="justify">Later on, I took it upon myself to learn Java. Since it shares similarities with C#, I found the learning process quite smooth. I dived into Java with the intention of crafting mods for the game Minecraft, along with developing server plugins. Throughout my journey of programming for Minecraft projects, I gained proficiency in working with a variety of different APIs.</p>

<p align="justify">During this period, I invested in my learning journey by enrolling in two Udemy courses. The first course delved into MySQL, offering a comprehensive understanding of SQL databases. I gained insights into the distinctions between SQL and No-SQL, delved into the inner workings of databases, and acquired proficiency in various commands needed to operate and maintain such databases.
<br/>
In the second course, I ventured into fullstack web development, comprehending both the front-end and back-end aspects of web applications. The curriculum encompassed key tools like NodeJS for backend functionality, MongoDB for database management, and ExpressJS. This comprehensive training empowered me to autonomously craft fully functional websites that seamlessly integrate both front-end and back-end components.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to all that, I have also learned to code for the Android OS, using Java. Because I have already learned the Java language, programming Android applications was fairly easy. I created an Android game based off of Miniclip's SoccerStars, as a school project, and was declared as the best Android project that was handed in.</p>

<p align="justify">In the mid-end of 2020 it was announced that browsers will stop supporing Flash. Therefore Everybody Edits would also come to an end, as it's a game that was running on Flash. Before the end of the game, the owner of the game, at the time, Xenonetix, has asked me to join his developer team, to create an offline version of Everybody Edits, so people would be able to download and play. Another developer (Seb135) and I have joined forces to create the offline version of Everybody Edits, and was later <a href="https://github.com/Seb-135/ee-offline">open-sourced on github</a>.</p>
