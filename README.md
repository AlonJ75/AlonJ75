## ðŸªª About Me:

<p align="justify">My name is Alon, I am 20 years old, and have 10 years of programming experience.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2012, I started coding while playing an online game called "Everybody Edits" (which is no longer available). I taught myself C# to make bots, which are like helper programs that tweak how the game works for my benefit. These bots were made using C# and the .NET framework, along with a library called PlayerIO (since the game ran on PlayerIO). This experience not only improved my coding skills but also gave me insights into how online games and servers function.</p>

  By the end of 2012 I have released my first bot to the public, named "Command Bot", available on MediaFire which received almost 1,000 downloads.

<p align="justify">Later on I started learning by myself Java. Due to the similarity to C#, it was pretty easy for me to learn. The reason of learning Java was to create mods for the game Minecraft, in addition to server plugins. Within my time of programming for Minecraft projects, I learnt how to use all sort of different APIs.</p>

<p align="justify">Meanwhile I have bought 2 courses on Udemy, the 1st course being a MySQL course teaching me everything about SQL databases, the difference between SQL to No-SQL, how the database works, and all the different commands I need to know to use and maintain such a database. The 2nd course was a fullstack web development course. The course tought me about the front end and the back end of a web application, and how they work together. The course covered subjects such as NodeJS as the backend server, MongoDB as a No-SQL database, ExpressJS, and much more. Made me become capable of creating my own fullstack website.</p>

<p align="justify">In addition to all that, I have also learned to code for the Android OS, using Java. Because I have already learned the Java language, programming Android applications was fairly easy. I created an Android game based off of Miniclip's SoccerStars, as a school project, and was declared as the best Android project that was handed in.</p>

<p align="justify">In the mid-end of 2020 it was announced that browsers will stop supporing Flash. Therefore Everybody Edits would also come to an end, as it's a game that was running on Flash. Before the end of the game, the owner of the game, at the time, Xenonetix, has asked me to join his developer team, to create an offline version of Everybody Edits, so people would be able to download and play. Another developer (Seb135) and I have joined forces to create the offline version of Everybody Edits, and was later <a href="https://github.com/Seb-135/ee-offline">open-sourced on github</a>.</p>
